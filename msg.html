        <h1>Happy Valentine's Day, my Love</h1>
        <p>You mean the world to me, and every moment with you is a cherished memory. I know I haven't always been the best boyfriend. I've made mistakes and hurt you, and for that, I am truly sorry. You deserve all the love and happiness in the world, and I promise to do better, to be the partner you deserve. 
            I promise to work on myself and our relationship every day because losing you is something I couldn't bear. You are my rock, my joy, my everything. I am grateful for your patience, forgiveness, and most of all, your love.
        </p>
        <p>I love you so much, my Serena.</p>
